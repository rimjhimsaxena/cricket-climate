# Motivation

1.  Heat reduces labor productivity \textcolor{brown}{[ISO 1989; Parsons 1993]}

2.  Lab experiments - WBTs rise above 25 celsius, task efficiency falls by 1%-2% \textcolor{brown}{[Hsiang 2010]}

3.  Controlled experiments do not capture real world

4.  Real World - Workers operate within physical limits and have room to increase effort in response to incentives.

5.  Individual worker level is not easily available - surveys of firms \textcolor{brown}{[Somanathan et al, 2020]} or aggregate firm level production data

# Research Question

What is the effect of temperature shocks on labor productivity of individual workers?

-   heterogeneity by time gap in temperature shock
-   effect of accumulation of heat
-   effect of excessive heat (\>$25^\circ$C)

Utilize quasi-experimental variation provided by cricket world cup to estimate adaptation to short run climate shock

# Contribution

1. Effect of temperature on labor productivity

    -   \textcolor{brown}{[Zivin \& Neidell, 2014; Sudarshan et.al, 2015; Sepp√§nen et.al, 2006; Adhvaryu et.al, 2014; Heal \& Park, 2016; Carleton \& Hsiang, 2016; LoPalo 2023]}

    -   First paper to utilize individual level sports data to estimate the impact of temperature shock on labor productivity 


2. Climate adaptation \& labor productivity 

    -   \textcolor{brown}{[Behrer \& Park, 2017; Chen \& Gong, 2021; Kjellstorm et.al, 2010]}
    -   First paper to estimate the productivity response of workers to climate adaptation of short run climate shock

3. Sports as labor market laboratory

    -   \textcolor{brown}{[Kahn, 2000; Fesselmeyer, 2021; Archsmith et.al, 2017; Flynn, 2022]}

# Setting

1.  Sports provide a setting to observe individual worker productivity & track location

2.  Cricket - a two sided bat and ball game

3.  2 teams - 11 players each

4.  Goal : To score maximum runs without losing wickets

5.  Player types - Batsmen, Bowlers, All-rounders

6.  Cricket T20 World Cup : October - November 2022

    -   Location Australia
    -   16 countries
    -   South Asia : India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan
    -   Europe : England, Ireland, Scotland, Netherlands
    -   Oceania : Australia, New Zealand
    -   Africa : South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe
    -   Middle East : United Arab Emirates
    -   Caribbean : West Indies

# Background - Cricket

How to play cricket?

| Format  | Number of Overs (Per Side) | Length       |
|---------|----------------------------|--------------|
| Test    | Unlimited                  | Up to 5 days |
| One Day | 50 Overs                   | 1 day        |
| T20     | 20 Overs                   | 3 hours      |

: Type of Cricket Games

# Background

-   Cricket is not commonly known to be as active as soccer or rugby

-   An international batsman produces heat equivalent to individual running at 8 kmph (5 mph)

    -   a day at the crease is equivalent to running a marathon with helmet, gloves, and pads (\textcolor{brown}{University of Portsmouth})

-   Cricket requires physical and mental skills (strategy, concentration & agility)

-   Batsmen face higher increase in core temperature than bowlers and fielders \textcolor{brown}{[Stay et.al., 2018]}

# Background

| Sector         | Estimated Heat Production (Watts/min) |
|----------------|---------------------------------------|
| Tourism        | 134 - 218                             |
| Agriculture    | 200 - 420                             |
| Construction   | 345                                   |
| Manufacturing  | 122 - 443                             |
| Transportation | 129 - 286                             |
| Cricket        | 216 - 387                             |

Identification comes from variation in level of heat shock within and across teams

\end{aligned}
$$
```
-   $y_{itmdv}$ measure of productivity for player $i$ in team $t$ playing in match $m$ on day $d$ at venue $v$
-   $\beta_{j}$ is the parameter of interest
-   $TEMPSHOCK$ difference in temperature from previous game to current
-   $GAPBIN$ gap in days between consecutive games
-   $X_{mdv}$ aggregate opposing team's temperature shock
-   $\theta_{t}$ team fixed effect
-   $\theta_{order}$ batting order (only used for batsmen)
-   $\theta_{type}$ game type - test, odi, t20, ipl
-   errors are clustered at player level

# Identification : DiD

In the absence of WC offering a climate shock, the players would have continued to behave the same.

```{=latex}

$$
```

-   $y_{itmdv}$ measure of productivity for player $i$ in team $t$ playing in match $m$ on day $d$ at venue $v$
-   $\beta_{3}$ is the parameter of interest
-   $treat$ = 0 for Australian team & = 1 for everyone else
-   $wc$ = 1 for all world cup games
-   $X_{mdv}$ aggregate opposing team's temperature shock
-   $\theta_{t}$ team fixed effect
